Lower ESR Solid Capacitors ensure better electronic conductivity for excellent system performance and longer lifespan. The back plate not only provides an aesthetical shape, but also enhances the structure of the graphics card to provide complete protection. WINDFORCE 2X cooling system features 2x 90mm unique blade fans, alternate spinning fan, composite copper heat pipe direct touch GPU and 3D active fan, together delivering an effective heat dissipation. The GIGABYTE \\u201cAlternate Spinning\\u201d is the only solution that can solve the turbulent airflow of adjacent fans. Since the adjacent fans rotate in the same direction, the airflow direction is opposite between the fans, which will cause turbulent airflow and reduce heat dissipation efficiency. GIGABYTE turns the adjacent fans in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing the turbulence and enhancing the airflow pressure. The airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface, effectively enhancing the airflow. The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game. It allows gamers to enjoy gameplay in complete silence when the system is running light or idle. The shape of the pure copper heat pipe maximizes the direct contact area with the GPU, enhancing heat transfer. The heat pipe also cover the VRAM through a large metal plate contact to ensure proper cooling. The composite heat-pipe combines thermal conductivity and phase transition to efficiently manage the heat transfer between two solid interfaces which increase cooling capacity.","excerpt":"Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1650 Super Windforce OC 4GB Graphics Card\\r\\nLower RDS(on) MOSFETs are specially designed to produce lower switching resistance for faster electric current charging and discharging at extremely low temperature.
